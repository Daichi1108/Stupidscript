Stupidscript

Very bad programming language. Super hard to use but it kinda works sometimes. Literally worst error messages you've ever seen. Don't use stupidscript you will lose so many brain cells.

It is fully functional with functions, objects, variables, control statements, and other simple stuff. it lacks alot of features tho and its super hard to use.
